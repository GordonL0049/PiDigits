# PiDigits
This is a way to calculate pi digits in Apps Script. This method calculates the top 12,500 digits of pi, and usually takes about 1,200 to 3,500 milliseconds. You will need to GET the url, and then in return, you will receive a comma separated list with the first item being the calculated result, and the second item has the time taken.

**:books: Implementation in MIT App Inventor**

Once you have deployed your Apps Script, copy the URL, and then head back to MIT App Inventor. Add a button, a label and a Web component. These blocks are all you need.
